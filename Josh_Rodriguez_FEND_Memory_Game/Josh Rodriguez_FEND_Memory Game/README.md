## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Basics

The objective of this game is to match all of the cards on the board as fast as possible and with as few moves as possible. Once all of the cards are matched, the Game Stats window will appear showing you your final stats and you can then choose to play again.

## Issues

1) In order to remove the stars on the score board depending on how many moves have been made, I had to write 2 functions. 1 function per star removal. I was not able to write just 1 function as I would get errors when doing so.
2) CSS: The game looks great on destop. But when I shrink the window down as if it were mobile or tablet, my moidal for when you finish the game does not look good at all. The rulebrick states that the game functionality should work across all devices and it does but the modal just doe not look well on smaller screens. I tried using flexbox as well as used % for sizes instead of px.
